This is a python-based project that simulates the working of a double pendulum. Matplotlib and associated libraries have been used. It shows a set of two graphs, one simulating the pendulum in air, and the other in water. With different parameters (length, mass, gravity), the difference in path traced by the bob is clearly depicted.

Instructions to run the code:
1. Download the zip file and extract it.
2. Go into the directory in which the zip file has been extracted. In the terminal window, type:
    cd Zense-Project-master/
3. Type python pendulum.py. This will execute the code.
